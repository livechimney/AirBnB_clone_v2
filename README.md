# AirBnB Clone: Phase # 4

Web dynamic with JQuery

## Description

Project attempts to clone the the AirBnB application and website, including the
database, storage, RESTful API, Web Framework, and Front End.  Currently the
application is designed to run with 2 storage engine models:

* File Storage Engine:

  * `/models/engine/file_storage.py`

* Database Storage Engine:

  * `/models/engine/db_storage.py`

  * To Setup the DataBase for testing and development, there are 2 setup
  scripts that setup a database with certain privileges: `setup_mysql_test.sql`
  & `setup_mysql_test.sql` (for more on setup, see below).

  * The Database uses Environmental Variables for tests.  To execute tests with
  the environmental variables prepend these declarations to the execution
  command:

```
$ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd \
HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db \
[COMMAND HERE]
```

## Run the web_dynamic version

To run this inside vagrant, add those two lines to the Vagrantfile:
```
config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5000, host: 5000
config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5001, host: 5001
```

The API will run on port 5001 and the page will run on port 5000.

In a first terminal inside the repo, run the API:
```
HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db HBNB_API_PORT=5001 python3 -m api.v1.app
```

In a second window inside the repo, run a page (for example 100-hbnb):
```
HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db HBNB_API_PORT=5000 python3 -m web_dynamic.100-hbnb
```

All the web dynamic Flask scripts, HTML templates and Javascript scripts are in the foler [web_dynamic](./web_dynamic).

## Setup

This project comes with various setup scripts to support automation, especially
during maintanence or to scale the entire project.  The following files are the
setupfiles along with a brief explanation:

* **`dev/setup.sql`:** Drops test and dev databases, and then reinitializes
the datbase.

  * Usage: `$ cat dev/setup.sql | mysql -uroot -p`

* **`setup_mysql_dev.sql`:** initialiezs dev database with mysql for testing

  * Usage: `$ cat setup_mysql_dev.sql | mysql -uroot -p`

* **`setup_mysql_test.sql`:** initializes test database with mysql for testing

  * Usage: `$ cat setup_mysql_test.sql | mysql -uroot -p`

* **`0-setup_web_static.sh`:** sets up nginx web server config file & the file
  structure.

  * Usage: `$ sudo ./0-setup_web_static.sh`

* **`3-deploy_web_static.py`:** uses 2 functions from (1-pack_web_static.py &
  2-do_deploy_web_static.py) that use the fabric3 python integration, to create
  a `.tgz` file on local host of all the local web static fils, and then calls
  the other function to deploy the compressed web static files.  Command must
  be executed from the `AirBnB_clone` root directory.

  * Usage: `$ fab -f 3-deploy_web_static.py deploy -i ~/.ssh/holberton -u ubuntu`

## Testing

### `unittest`

This project uses python library, `unittest` to run tests on all python files.
All unittests are in the `./tests` directory with the command:

* File Storage Engine Model:

  * `$ python3 -m unittest discover -v ./tests/`

* DataBase Storage Engine Model

```
$ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd \
HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db \
python3 -m unittest discover -v ./tests/
```

---

### All Tests

The bash script `init_test.sh` executes all these tests for both File Storage &
DataBase Engine Models:

  * checks `pep8` style

  * runs all unittests

  * runs all w3c_validator tests

  * cleans up all `__pycache__` directories and the storage file, `file.json`

  * **Usage `init_test.sh`:**

```
$ ./dev/init_test.sh
```

---

### CLI Interactive Tests

* This project uses python library, `cmd` to run tests in an interactive command
  line interface.  To begin tests with the CLI, run this script:

#### File Storage Engine Model

```
$ ./console.py
```

#### To execute the CLI using the Database Storage Engine Model:

```
$ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd \
HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db \
./console.py
```

#### For a detailed description of all tests, run these commands in the CLI:

```
(hbnb) help help
List available commands with "help" or detailed help with "help cmd".
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
Amenity    City  Place   State  airbnb  create   help  show
BaseModel  EOF   Review  User   all     destroy  quit  update

(hbnb) help User
class method with .function() syntax
        Usage: User.<command>(<id>)
(hbnb) help create
create: create [ARG] [PARAM 1] [PARAM 2] ...
        ARG = Class Name
        PARAM = <key name>=<value>
                value syntax: "<value>"
        SYNOPSIS: Creates a new instance of the Class from given input ARG
                  and PARAMS. Key in PARAM = an instance attribute.
        EXAMPLE: create City name="Chicago"
                 City.create(name="Chicago")
```

* Tests in the CLI may also be executed with this syntax:

  * **destroy:** `<class name>.destroy(<id>)`

  * **update:** `<class name>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, <attribute value>)`

  * **update with dictionary:** `<class name>.update(<id>,
    <dictionary representation>)`

<center> <h1>HBNB - The Console</h1> </center>

This repository contains the initial stage of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

=======
